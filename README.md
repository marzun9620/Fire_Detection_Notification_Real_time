# Fire_Detection_Notification_Real_time
This code performs real-time fire detection and notification using an ESP32 CAM module integrated with YOLOv5, an existing fire detection model sourced from GitHub. The ESP32 streams live video input, which is processed frame-by-frame to detect signs of fire. Upon detection, the system sends alerts in real time, facilitating swift response and monitoring.
